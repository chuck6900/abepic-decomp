# Angry Birds Epic Decompilation
This is a work in progress decompilation of Angry Birds Epic. It's based off of [IGTBAP's version 2.0.25241.4080 (2.0.0) event APK](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JokYH5SHYaeKndeVSVdADczIygLBQVfZ/view?usp=sharing) and [OBB](https://www.mediafire.com/file/iuyewy4ziep5jm0).
Keep in mind that this is a WORK IN PROGRESS and I'm not expecting to complete this any time soon.
